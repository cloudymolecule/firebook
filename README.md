# README

FireBook is a basic barbershop booking system. A client calls the shop, and a barber is assigned to said client at a given time. 

## INSTALLATION

Fork and clone this repository, run 'bundle install' from the terminal to install the required gems. To run locally, fire up a server like the one included with rails, by typing 'rails s'

## USAGE

Start by adding a workday to the list, select the appropiate date and times and click create. You're ready to go. From there you can select a time bracket, a barber and a client to create a booking.

## ROADMAP

In the future I'd like to display number of people booked at a certain time and total number of clients for the day, perhaps allow the selection of time for the booking so FireBook can also be used in salons.
